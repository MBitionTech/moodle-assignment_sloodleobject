SLOODLE object assignment type

This is an assignment type for assignments involving virtual objects created in Second Life or OpenSim.
It is used in conjunction with the PrimDrop SLOODLE object, which can be rezzed in Second Life or OpenSim to allow students to submit assignments of this type.

It requires the main SLOODLE module:
https://github.com/sloodle/moodle-mod_sloodle

It should be installed under the mod/assignment/type/ directory of your Moodle site.

See http://www.sloodle.org for more information, and post any questions or comments in the forums there.
